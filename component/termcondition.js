                    1.1 This Terms of Use ("Terms") is between the respondent ("you") or user and Mumbai University-Online
                    Psychometrics
                    Centre ("MU-OPC"). It governs your access to and use of this website for the purpose of taking
                    psychometric tests.
                    By accessing our website, you agree to have read, understood and be bound by these Terms and the Privacy
                    Policy. It
                    provides information about the platform. This is a research project at Department of Applied Psychology,

                    of Mumbai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.2 The MU-OPC is an outcome of ‘Online Psychometrics: Data Science and Public Policy Project’ led by
                    Dr. Vivek
                    Belhekar (henceforth referred to as "lead researcher"), which has been approved by University of Mumbai.
                    This
                    project is purely aimed at scientific research in the discipline of Psychology and related
                    interdisciplinary social
                    sciences. The data obtained is used for research and public policy purposes.

                    1.3 In order to advance psychology and mental health into the public sphere, the website provides
                    feedback for the
                    psychometrics taken by a respondent. However, this feedback is based purely on the responses provided by
                    the
                    respondent (i.e. you) and is computer-generated. No personal verification of the feedback is done by the
                    lead
                    researcher. The primary purpose of the website is NOT to provide psychometric feedback but the primary
                    and sole
                    purpose of it is sound, scientific research. The website charges no fee from you.

                    investigated
                    in this project and may not have literature supporting them. In that case, they are considered as
                    outcome of the
                    project. The instruments developed by lead researcher and other researchers are available on the website
                    are their

                    governed under
                    this agreement. E.g., MUII-S and MUII as two versions of MU Interest Inventory with different lengths.

                    2.5 Psychometric properties: Psychometric properties of the test include reliability, validity, norms
                    and

                </p>
                <p>2.6 Report: Feedback generated form the test scores of the user. This is computer generated feedback.
                    This is not
                    exclusively written for user. Broad categories of scores on psychological tests were identified and
