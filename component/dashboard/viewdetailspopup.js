                            <p> <strong>Interests</strong>
                                represent preferences for certain types of tasks associated with work activities. 
                                They are what keep us motivated and energized. With a firm understanding of our interests,
                                we can pursue enjoyment and satisfaction within our lives as well as our careers.
                                Interest Inventory is a test designed to measure and evaluate the level of interest in different areas. </p>
                            <p> <strong>The Mumbai University  Interest Inventory (MU-II)</strong> measures the extent of interest in<strong> 9 vocational areas,</strong>
                                namely Leadership, Artistic, Altruism, Social, Investigative, Conventional, Realistic (Production), Realistic (Adventure) and Erudition. 
                                It is based on two interest models; John Hollandâ€™s RIASEC model which classifies six major types of interests; Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional;
                                that are influential in vocational careers and ORVIS (Oregon Vocational Interest Scale) which adds the dimension of Erudition and two divisions of Realistic Interests. </p>
